## Answers:

1. Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
related that happens locally on your computer.
2. git branch "name of branch"
3. Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
4. First, you edit your files in the working directory. When you're ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with git add . After you're happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with git commit.
5. When you make a change to the main branch you can create a new branch for the commit to be reviewed by someone else to see if it should be pushed to the main branch.
